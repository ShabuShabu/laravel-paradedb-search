[![Total Downloads](https://img.shields.io/packagist/dt/shabushabu/laravel-paradedb-search.svg?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/shabushabu/laravel-paradedb-search)

Integrates the `pg_search` Postgres extension by [ParadeDB](https://docs.paradedb.com/search/quickstart) into [Laravel](https://laravel.com)

## Supported minimum versions

| PHP | Laravel | PostgreSQL | pg_search |
|-----|---------|------------|-----------|
| 8.4 | 12.0    | 17.0       | 0.22.0    |

## Installation

> [!CAUTION]
> Please note that this is a new package and, even though it is well tested, it should be considered pre-release software

Before installing the package you should install and enable the [pg_search](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_search) extension.

You can then install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require shabushabu/laravel-paradedb-search
```

You can also publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="paradedb-search-config"
```

These are the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    'index_suffix' => env('PG_SEARCH_INDEX_SUFFIX', 'idx'),
    'highlighting_tag' => env('PG_SEARCH_HIGHLIGHTING_TAG', '<b></b>'),
    'remove_global_scopes' => [],
];
```

## Usage

The documentation for the v1 API can be found [here](V1.md)!

### A word of caution

While it is possible to combine ParadeDB queries with regular Eloquent queries, you will incur some performance penalties.

For optimal performance it is recommended to let the `bm25` index do as much work as possible!

## Testing

The tests require a PostgreSQL database, which can easily be set up by running the following script:

```bash
composer testdb
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that both [pg_search](https://github.com/paradedb/paradedb/tree/dev/pg_search#installation) and [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#installation) extensions need to be available already.

Then run the tests:

```bash
composer test
```

Or with test coverage:

```bash
composer test-coverage
```

Or with type coverage:

```bash
composer type-coverage
```

Or run PHPStan: 

```bash
composer analyse
```

### ParadeDB test table

There is also a command that allows you to create and drop the built-in test table

```bash
php artisan paradedb:test-table create
```
